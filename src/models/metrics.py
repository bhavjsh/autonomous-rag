        Weights (sum to 1.0) and their rationale:

        - recall_at_k (35%, highest): a chunk missing from the top-k is
          unrecoverable downstream, so retrieval coverage matters most.
        - ndcg_at_k (25%, above MRR): rewards ranking all relevant chunks near
          the top, a better multi-chunk signal than MRR's first-hit-only view.
        - mrr (20%): position of the first relevant chunk; narrower than NDCG.
        - precision_at_k (10%): a few irrelevant chunks are cheap, so this
          matters far less than recall.
        - context_recall (10%): groundedness signal; low because it overlaps
          with recall_at_k and is noisier to measure.

        Weights are hardcoded; making them configurable is tracked in issue #22.
